	<h1 class="h1-class">Everything You Need to Know About Self Storage<h1>
	<p class="peragraph p-class">When renting a storage space for the first time, there is a lot to think about. Do you require a small, medium, or large-sized storage unit? Is it necessary to have a temperature control system? What about location, safety, security, and customer support? What are you allowed to store? How do you pick the right facility?</p>
	<p class="peragraph p-class">Self-storage may be a confusing topic, so we've written this blog to help you get a grip on the fundamentals.</p>
	<h2 class="h2-class">What Exactly is Self-Storage?</h2>
	<p class="peragraph p-class">Before we dive in, it’s important to understand what the term ‘self-storage’ means.</p>
	<p class="peragraph p-class">Self-storage facilities allow users to rent and keep space for their personal or business possessions while they are away from home. A storage unit is normally rented on a month-to-month basis in most cases.</p>
	<p class="peragraph p-class">With self-storage facilities, you have a great deal of flexibility when it comes to making use of that space. You have complete freedom to pack and organize your storage unit however you like, to come and go as you choose during the facility's open hours, and to store or remove anything as you please.</p>
	<h2 class="h2-class">Why Rent a Storage Unit?</h2>
	<p class="peragraph p-class">A storage unit allows you to safely store your belongings for a while. Storage units can be rented out for a variety of reasons and needs, such as: </p>
	<h2 class="h2-class">Moving Houses</h2>
	<p class="peragraph p-class">Some of the most common reasons for renting self-storage units include storing belongings while shifting to a new house, transitioning between leases, living in temporary accommodation, and traveling across the nation.</p>
	<h2 class="h2-class">Residential Transitions</h2>
	<p class="peragraph p-class">Moving in with another person might lead to a lot of duplicative belongings, but it could be necessary to preserve them in case of a future relocation to a larger property.</p>
	<p class="peragraph p-class">It's likely that you'll need storage space if you're selling your current home and buying a new one at the same time. It is also possible that you may need to temporarily relocate into furnished housing and will want a place to store your furniture until you can purchase your new house. </p>
	<p class="peragraph p-class">Whatever the reason for the relocation, be it a divorce, a downsizing for retirement, or a transition to a new home, self-storage may help lessen the strain when unexpected life changes occur and gives you the peace of mind that comes with knowing that your belongings are safe and secure.</p>
	<h2 class="h2-class">Redecoration and Renovations</h2>
	<p class="peragraph p-class">A house renovation can be an exciting but messy time! Storage units are a great solution for keeping your belongings clean while there’s work going on at the house. Keeping your furniture secure from spills will allow you to do your decorating much more quickly and easily without the need to hop over objects.</p>
	<h2 class="h2-class">Decluttering</h2>
